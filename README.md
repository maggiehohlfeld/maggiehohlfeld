### Hi there 👋
I'm Maggie. I work at GitHub as a Technical Business Operations Manager. I like to get things done and have fun along the way. Meaning I try to bring a sense of humor--and humility--to everything that I do. 

Outside of work, I love:
- 📝 Creative writing. I have been working on a novel for a few years now. One day I'll finish it. One day...
- 🐶 Dogs. I have a pug that I adore, and generally love all dogs. 
- 🤓 Trivia nights... even if I'm terrible at them. 
- 📺 And of course, watching Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc.
