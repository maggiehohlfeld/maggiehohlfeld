### Hi there 👋
I'm Maggie, a Sr. Program Manager at GitHub on the Engineering Ops team. I like to get things done and have fun along the way. What does that mean exactly? I try to bring a sense of humor--and humility--to everything that I do. 

Outside of work, I love:
- 📝 Creative writing. I have been working on a novel for a few years now. One day I'll finish it. One day...
- 🐶 Dogs. I have a pug that I adore, and generally love all dogs. 
- 🌊 Being on the water. I love to kayak, paddleboard, swim, ride boats. Anything to do with water. 
- 📺 Watching Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc. I got *really* into YouTube during the pandemic.
